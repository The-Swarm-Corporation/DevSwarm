# DevSwarm

Develop production-grade applications effortlessly with a single prompt, powered by a swarm of v0-driven autonomous agents operating 24/7 for fully autonomous software development.

**Prompt â†’ App**

DevSwarm leverages a structured multi-agent system, orchestrated by a CTO agent, to deliver seamless, high-quality software development with continuous updates, autonomous deployment, and customizable configurations.

## Features

- **Structured Multi-Agent Team**: Eight specialized developer agents collaborate to build robust applications.
- **CTO Agent Oversight**: A dedicated CTO agent directs the team, ensuring strategic alignment and efficiency.
- **24/7 Autonomous Development**: Continuous code updates run around the clock for rapid development cycles.
- **Autonomous Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy applications on Vercel with zero manual intervention.
- **Fully Customizable Settings**: Flexible parameters allow tailored workflows to meet specific project needs.
- **Autonomous Testing & Improvement**: Built-in unit tests and continuous improvement ensure code quality.

## Powered By

- [Swarms](https://github.com/swarms) for multi-agent orchestration
- [v0](https://v0.dev) for AI-driven development

## Installation

> **Note**: DevSwarm is currently in early access. Follow these steps to set up the environment.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Vercel CLI (`npm install -g vercel`)
- Git
- API keys for Swarms and v0 (request access via their respective platforms)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devswarm/devswarm.git
   cd devswarm
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following:
     ```plaintext
     SWARMS_API_KEY=your_swarms_api_key
     V0_API_KEY=your_v0_api_key
     VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
     ```
4. Start the DevSwarm CLI:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Usage

1. **Initialize a Project**:
   Run the following command and provide a prompt describing your application:
   ```bash
   devswarm init "Create a full-stack e-commerce platform with React and Node.js"
   ```
2. **Monitor Development**:
   The CTO agent will assign tasks to developer agents, and code updates will be logged in real-time.
3. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   Once the application is ready, DevSwarm automatically deploys to Vercel. Access the deployment URL in the logs.
4. **Customize Settings**:
   Modify configurations in `config/devswarm.json` to adjust agent behavior, testing frequency, or deployment options.

### Example Prompt
```plaintext
"Build a task management app with a React frontend, Express backend, and MongoDB integration."
```

## Configuration

Customize DevSwarm via the `config/devswarm.json` file. Key options include:

- `agentCount`: Number of developer agents (default: 8)
- `updateInterval`: Frequency of code updates (in seconds)
- `testCoverage`: Minimum unit test coverage percentage
- `deploymentPlatform`: Target platform (default: "vercel")

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "agentCount": 8,
  "updateInterval": 3600,
  "testCoverage": 90,
  "deploymentPlatform": "vercel"
}
```
