Usage

Initialize a Project:Run the following command and provide a prompt describing your application:devswarm init "Create a full-stack e-commerce platform with React and Node.js"


Monitor Development:The CTO agent will assign tasks to developer agents, and code updates will be logged in real-time.
Deploy to Vercel:Once the application is ready, DevSwarm automatically deploys to Vercel. Access the deployment URL in the logs.
Customize Settings:Modify configurations in config/devswarm.json to adjust agent behavior, testing frequency, or deployment options.

Example Prompt
"Build a task management app with a React frontend, Express backend, and MongoDB integration."

Configuration

agentCount: Number of developer agents (default: 8)
updateInterval: Frequency of code updates (in seconds)
testCoverage: Minimum unit test coverage percentage
deploymentPlatform: Target platform (default: "vercel")

Example configuration:
{
  "agentCount": 8,
  "updateInterval": 3600,
